<h1>Software Project Prerequisites - Part 1</h1>
<p>Whenever I started a new project, sometimes on a new platform, I tried to make a list of prerequisites that are necessary for ensuring the project's success. I will try to group in this first post of the series what I believe is essential for being able to focus on development and not on side tasks.</p>
<p>First and most important is the source control. Be it SVN, Git, Hg, TFS or any other, it is essential that a software project is stored in a source control environment.</p>
<p>Secondly comes the Continuous Integration environment which is sometimes in close relationship with the Continuous Deployment environment, only because it is often executed by the same tool. For this I believe TeamCity and Jenkins are the most popular platforms.</p>
